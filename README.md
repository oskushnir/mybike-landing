2.Technologies that were used:
  1.HTML: The structure of the web page is defined using HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). This code includes various HTML elements like <!DOCTYPE>, <html>, <head>, <meta>, <title>, <link>, <script>, <body>, <header>, <aside>, <main>, <section>, <footer>, and more.

  2.CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): CSS is used to style and format the HTML elements. The code includes CSS properties, selectors, and custom classes. Some common CSS properties and techniques used in this code include:

    a.Selectors: Elements are selected using classes (e.g., .header, .about-us) and HTML element tags (e.g., h1, a).
    b.Layout: Grid-based layout is implemented using display: grid and grid-template-columns. Media queries (e.g., @media) are used to apply styles based on screen size (tablet and desktop).
    c.Font Styling: Various text-related properties are used, such as font-size, font-weight, line-height, and font-family.
    d.Colors: Colors are defined using hexadecimal color codes (e.g., #1d1d1d) and are applied to elements.
    e.Transitions: CSS transitions are used to create smooth animations when hovering over elements (e.g., buttons, icons).
    f.Backgrounds: Background images are set for elements like the header and footer.
    g.Borders and Borders Radius: Styles for borders, border-radius, and box shadows are applied to elements.

  3.Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets): The code contains Sass code. Sass is a preprocessor for CSS. It allows for the use of variables (e.g., $header-title-color) and mixins (e.g., @mixin and @content) to make         the i.CSS more maintainable and efficient.

  4.Responsive Web Design: The code demonstrates responsive web design techniques using media queries. Different styles are applied based on the screen size (tablet and desktop) to ensure the web page adapts to different devices.

  5.CSS Flexbox and Grid: The code utilizes CSS Flexbox and Grid Layout to create flexible and grid-based layouts for various sections of the web page.

  6.HTML Links and Anchors: Links (<a>) are used for navigation and to create hyperlinks to other pages or sections within the same page (e.g., navigation links in the menu).

  7.HTML Forms: An HTML form is used for contact information. Form elements include text inputs (<input>), a textarea (<textarea>), and a submit button (<button>).

  8.External Resources: External resources such as fonts (from Google Fonts) and image files (e.g., icons) are loaded using <link> and <script> tags.

  9.Poppins Font: The code loads the Poppins font family from Google Fonts.
